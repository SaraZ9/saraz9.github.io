# ✨Who Am I✨ 

Hello! I’m Sara Zhang, a tech enthusiast with a creative side and a passion for storytelling. When I'm not coding or working on AI projects, I love exploring different hobbies that keep me inspired and engaged.

### My Creative Side 🎨📱
I started a small business creating personalized phone cases. I'd cut out images of customers' loved ones, pets, or favorite celebrities and transform them into custom acrylic designs. Running this venture myself, I handled everything from customer communication and sourcing materials to designing, creating, and shipping the final products. It was my first hands-on experience with project management, where I learned the value of good communication skills and of attention to details.

### Customer Service Experience 🧋😊
During a gap year I had, I worked at a milk tea shop, because I wanted to explore different paths while reflecting on my future. During this experience, my days were filled with interactions that promoted a lot of introspection. It kept me focused while I enjoyed my time reading and exploring various career options.

### Language and Volunteering 🌍❤️🐈
I love exploring different cultures and languages, which led me to once work as a translator for comics and to volunteer at an elementary school. I've also volunteered at an elementary school for a year and helped organize events with an animal adoption group. These experiences were incredibly rewarding, and I loved connecting with people and animals alike.


### Movies, TV, and Puzzles 🎬📚🧩
Movies and TV shows are a big part of my life—I've watched over 800 of them! I love spotting hidden details and themes, and "Modern Family" is my all-time favorite. I'm also a big fan of books and puzzles, though I've paused on puzzles for now until I can figure out where to put them all.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope this page gives you a glimpse into who I am beyond my work. If you share any of these interests, I’d love to connect and chat!
