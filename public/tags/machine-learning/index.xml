      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/project2/</guid>
      <description>This project presents a deep learning method to enhance compressed images specifically for machine learning tasks, addressing the performance degradation caused by image distortions such as blurring and blocking. The approach combines an image restoration network and a classification network to optimize compressed image quality for machine consumption.</description>

      <title>AI Tank Battle Project</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/project4/</link>

      <description>This project was a hands-on exploration of Artificial Intelligence, completed as part of **CPEN 502 - Architecture for Learning Systems**. The primary objective was to develop an intelligent tank, leveraging **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Neural Networks (NNs)**, to autonomously battle against explicitly programmed tanks within a game environment. Through this project, I applied machine learning techniques to design an unsupervised tank that can adapt to its environment and optimize its performance over time.</description>
