      <description>This project aims to protect digital privacy by using a deep learning model, YOLOv8n, to detect sensitive information in WeChat screenshots. The model addresses privacy concerns by automatically identifying and allowing anonymization of personal details, enhancing security in digital media sharing.</description>

      <title>AI Tank Battle Project</title>

      <description>This project was a hands-on exploration of Artificial Intelligence, completed as part of **CPEN 502 - Architecture for Learning Systems**. The primary objective was to develop an intelligent tank, leveraging **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Neural Networks (NNs)**, to autonomously battle against explicitly programmed tanks within a game environment. Through this project, I applied machine learning techniques to design an unsupervised tank that can adapt to its environment and optimize its performance over time.</description>
