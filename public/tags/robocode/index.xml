      <description>This project was a hands-on exploration of Artificial Intelligence, completed as part of **CPEN 502 - Architecture for Learning Systems**. The primary objective was to develop an intelligent tank, leveraging **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Neural Networks (NNs)**, to autonomously battle against explicitly programmed tanks within a game environment. Through this project, I applied machine learning techniques to design an unsupervised tank that can adapt to its environment and optimize its performance over time.</description>
